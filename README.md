# Networks of Pompeian elites based on inscriptions

---

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to reconstruct the past social networks of elites and sub-elites in Pompeii as they are preserved on Latin inscriptions. We try to replicate networks created by Broekaert (2020), using several approaches ranging from manual to semi-automated extraction of data.

# How to use this repository

## Sources and prerequisites
First, we need to manually extract references to the used epigraphic data from Broekaert (2020) and then extract those inscriptions from the LIRE dataset. Only then, we can start reconstructing the nodes and edges on the basis of the available Latin text. We use the same definition for elites as Broekaert to see if we can come up with the same results.
